# Near-Universal TMs
This script is for Pokémon Essentials. It makes all pokémon, except a few specific ones, learn the near universal moves as TM/TR/HM/Tutor, so isn't necessary to add the move to the PBS learnset.

Example: All pokémon can learn Snore, except some species like Magikarp.

## Compatibility
Doesn't work on Essentials versions v18.1 or older.

## Installation
Follow the [Script](/Script.rb) instructions.
